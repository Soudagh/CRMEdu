/**
 * Contains classes responsible for the application's service layer, including REST controllers, data transfer objects, and data mappings.
 * <p>
 * The {@code controller} package provides RESTful endpoints for handling HTTP requests and managing resources like {@code Student}, {@code Tutor}, etc. The
 * {@code dto} package contains data transfer objects used for transferring data between layers and between the application and external clients. The
 * {@code mapping} package handles the transformation between domain models and data transfer objects (DTOs), ensuring data consistency and separation of
 * concerns.
